# Module Three Challenge - Employee Payroll Tracker

## Description

The objective of this assignment was to modify starter code to create an employee payroll tracker application. The application will enable the user to enter an employee's name and salary. After entering as many employees as needed, the user will see the employees in a list that displays their names and respective salaries. The list is organized alphabetically by the employee's last names. When opening the browser console, the user will see the the total number of employees and the average salary. This application also has a feature to choose an employee at random and that can be seen in the browser console.
